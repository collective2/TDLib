This repo contains source code and examples for using the TDAmeritrade API

The developer web site is located at https://developer.tdameritrade.com/

Using the API requires 5 different values that you retrieve in different ways. Read the file GettingTheKeys.pdf to see a discussion and walkthrough. Getting all of the keys together requires some patience, different logins and copying and pasting values around. 

The HelloWorld program is a short console app that will pull the latest quote for the SPY. Running this successfully means that you've configured the keys in appkeys.json correctly.
