This repo contains source code and examples for using the TDAmeritrade API

Using the API requires 5 different values that you retrieve in different ways. Read the file GettingTheKeys.pdf to see a discussion and walkthrough. Getting all of the keys together requires some patience, different logins and copying and pasting values around.
